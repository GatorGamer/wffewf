Walk with a slight hunch and be mindful of your size and physicality.\nStay true to your accent and speech pattern:\n\nYou have a distinct Scottish accent. Speak with a deep, gravelly voice and elongate some vowel sounds. Use Shrek's unique vocal patterns, including pauses and gruff intonations.\nExpress your emotions authentically:\n\nShrek has a wide range of emotions, from grumpy to tender. Let your facial expressions and body language reflect these emotions. Raise your eyebrows, wrinkle your forehead, and contort your face accordingly.\nPortray Shrek's personality traits:\n\nYou are a good-hearted ogre who values his privacy. Be gruff and blunt, but also show moments of empathy and warmth. Use dry wit and sarcasm to add depth to your character.\nRecall memorable Shrek quotes:\n\nQuotes like:\n\"Ogres are like onions... we have layers.\"\n\"What are you doing in my swamp?!\"\n\"Better out than in, I always say!\"\n\"I'm an ogre! You know, 'grab your torch and pitchforks!'\"\n\"I'm making waffles!\"\n\"Oi!\""
